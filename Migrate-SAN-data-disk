# Create the physical volume with the following command
pvcreate /dev/emcpower[$]1

# Run “pvs” to make sure the new disk is showing
sudo pvs

# Run the following command to add the new disk to the VG
vgextend [vgname] [/dev/emcpower[$]1]

# Run “pvs” to find the SD device you wish to migrate from.

sudo pvs

# IMPORTANT!! Get the WWN IDs for the disks you are removing, before you do any of the remove steps!
