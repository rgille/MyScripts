# Migrating Oracle RAC Boot LUN
#
# Place server in Block-o-matic, using IE
# http://emon/tngreports/BlockOMatic.asp

# Run script to verify the partitions are correct
# If not successful contact Joe Krakora in IE&D
sudo /usr/local/share/scripts/test/chkpart

# Stop the Oracle service and cause a failover and make sure the service doesn't come 
# back up after multiple reboots if necessary.
sudo /orashare/bin/sysadmora stop boot_disabled 

# The status command below should come back with no information
sudo /orashare/bin/sysadmora status

# Verify that VPLEX and XIO paths can be managed by PowerPath
# VPLEX         status = managed
# XtremIO       status = managed
sudo powermt display options

# If they are not managed run the following command to enable
sudo powermt manage class=vplex
sudo powermt manage class=xtremio

# Take system out of powerpath control 
cd /etc/opt/emcpower
sudo ./emcpbfs_linux upgrade

# Need to remove the PowerPath kernel from the grub menu.
# Check to see what the default is set to and count, starting at 0, down the list and 
# find the current kernel. This should have (PowerPath) at the end.  Remove the 
# Powerpath disk kernel line and change default to the same kernel without PP
sudo vi /boot/grub/menu.lst

# Now download a script that will run the powerpath configure during boot to setup 
# powerpath control of the kernel. Make the script executable.
cd /usr/scripts/runonce (does not work)
sudo wget http://kickstartprod/install/runonce_powerpath_config -O /usr/scripts/runonce/runonce_powerpath_config
sudo chmod +x /usr/scripts/runonce/runonce_powerpath_config

# Shutdown server so SAN team can swing the boot lun to VPLEX
sudo shutdown -r now

# note: issues with shutdown like umount fails and hangs the server, go to UCB and do a shutdown ungracefully

# Advise SAN team the server is ready
# After the SAN work is completed the server will sometimes boot after a UCS change.
# Power off the server and do a clean boot because many times it will not see the new 
# VPLEX paths. The server will reboot again on its own during the boot process because 
# it’s running the “emcpbfs_linux config” script to allow powerpath to control the kernel.
# During the 1st boot and aas soon as you can connect back onto the server edit the fstab file but only 
# open and close without any changes. At this point the server will reboot.
sudo vi /etc/fstab

# Once server is up and running after second reboot, make sure rootvg is set to an 
# emcpower device and grub is setup for default for the new powerpath controlled kernel.
sudo pvs

# Good output…Bad output, see troubleshooting section
sudo powermt display dev=[rootvg emcpower device]

# Restart Oracle High Availability Services 
sudo initctl start oracle-ohasd  

# Restart Oracle and enable boot
sudo /orashare/bin/sysadmora start boot_enabled

# note: it takes a while for the CRS daemon to startup so it will error, just keep checking processes.

# Check to make sure all the Oracle daemons are running. There should be 9 total and 
# will take a couple of minutes
ps -ef | grep d.bin

# Check the status of the instances
sudo /orashare/bin/sysadmora status

# Troubleshooting

# Server errors out at fsck during boot and now in kernel panic
# Using the same method as going into single user mode, place a “fastboot” at the end of the kernel
#argument to bypass any fsck that happens during boot

# Server fails when running the emcpbfs_linux config during boot
# Allow it to boot into normal kernel and run the following to manually attempt to configure for powerpath
cd /etc/opt/emcpower
sudo ./emcpbfs_linux config

# It will either complete successfully or it will error and will have to troubleshoot
#Reboot the server
sudo shutdown -r now

# Server fails on fstab during the emcpbfs_linux config script
# After the server boots into the OS, open fstab in vi and then close without saving
sudo vi /etc/fstab
cd /etc/opt/emcpower
sudo ./emcpbfs_linux config
sudo shutdown -r now

# oravg is not found during boot and fastboot will not pass
# Go into single user mode and mark disk as 0 0 in fstab
# Make sure to remember what it was before
# Boot server normally
# Change fstab back to what the disk should be
# Make sure the disk is active in LVM
sudo vgchange -a y oravg

# Mount all the disks
sudo mount -a

# Check df -h to make sure oravg showed up
df -h

# Oracle software fails to start
# Check to see if ASM can see the disks
sudo oracleasm listdisks

# If nothing comes back then run a scandisk
sudo oracleasm scandisks

# Restart clusterware if you had to scandisk
sudo initctl restart oracle-ohasd  

# Check to see if all 9 daemons started for Oracle
ps -ef | grep d.bin
